1. What shell command uses the man program to print all the commands that have a specific word in their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)

Explanation : I first type in the command "man man", then read through the page and found
              the command that says, "Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the
              keyword printf as regular expression. Print out any matches."

Answer : man man
         man -k printf, "printf" is the keyword

2.Where are the mv and sh programs located in the file system? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation: I first type in command "man -k path", then read through the listing and
             found the command which that says, "shows the full path of (shell) commands."

Answer : man -k path, "path" is the keyword
       	 which mv
	 which sh

	 The mv program locates in /usr/bin/mv.
	 The sh program locates in /usr/bin/sh.

3.What executable programs have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r,
and what do they do? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use echo command to find the the locations of the executable programs.
		After I find the locations, I am searching through the directory with program
		names that are two characters and end in r. Character ‘?’ indicates one
		character. 

Answer: 
	echo $PATH
	man find
	find /usr/local/cs/bin -executable -name ?r
	man pr
	man tr

	Returned output from “echo $PATH” : 
	/usr/local/cs/bin:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/u/cs/ugrad/sum/perl5/bin:/		         	
	usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/cs/bin:/u/cs/ugrad/sum/bin

	Returned output from the find command : 
	/usr/local/cs/bin/pr
	/usr/local/cs/bin/tr

	pr (1)               - convert text files for printing
	tr (1)               - translate or delete characters

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file
actually is executed? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use command "man -k directory" to find about the ls command.
              Then, I use the man command to find out more about the ls -l command.
              The command ls -l lists the total files in the directory and subdirectories

Answer : man -k directory
         man ls
         ls -l /usr/bin/emacs
         ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs. 

	 The symbolic link is executing the /usr/bin/emacs-24.3. 

5. What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program?
Why are they different programs?

Explanation : I first type in command "man gcc" then read through the listing
              and found the command "--version", which print the version number 

Answer : man gcc
       	 /usr/bin/gcc --version
	 gcc --version

	 The version number of /usr/bin/gcc is gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)
	 The version number of plain gcc is gcc (GCC) 8.2.0

	 They are different because /usr/bin/gcc refers to the gcc in the user bin directory
	 while the plain gcc is located at the shared library

6. The chmod program changes permissions on a file.
What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?

Answer : u+sx means the owner of the file is given two extra permissions which are
       	 set user or group ID on execution and execute (or search for directories).

	 o-w means permission to write is removed from the users who are not the owner of
	 the file or members of the group

7. Use the find command to find all directories modified in the last four weeks that are
located under (or are the same as) the directory /usr/local/cs. List any shell commands
you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use the man command to read the descriptions of the find command.
              Among the descriptions, I found "-type d" & "-mtime" are useful. 

Answer : man find
         find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
         find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc -l 
         The total number of directories are 309

8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links?
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use which command to find out the path of the find command.
              Then use the man command to read the descriptions of the find command and wc command.
              I found out "type l" in find command about symbolic link.
              I found out "-l" in wc command about printing the newline counts 


Answer : which find (gives me /usr/bin/find) 
       	 find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l

	 There are 253 symbolic links in total.
      	 
9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory? Use the last-modified time
to determine age. Specify the name of the file without the /usr/lib64/ prefix.
Consider files whose names start with ".".
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use man command to read the descriptions about find command.
              Then, I found out "-t" in the descriptions about sort by modification time, newest first
              Also, I found out "-l" about use a long listing format

Answer : man ls
       	 ls -t -l /usr/lib64

	 The oldest regular file is librom1394.so.0.3.0

10. Where does the locale command get its data from?
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I first use the man command to read through the descriptions of the locale
              command

Answer : man locale
       	 The locale command get its data from the environment variables in the shell profile
	 file

11. In Emacs, what commands have downcase in their name?
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I read the GNU Emacs Reference Card and find out the Emacs command that
describes show commands matching a string.

Answer : C-h a downcase
         
         downcase-dwim
         downcase-region
         downcase-word

12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-r through C-M-v do?
Can you list their actions concisely?
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I found out the descriptions each of the Emacs keystroke by using the command “C-h k” 
              followed by the Emacs keystrokes.

Answer: 
	C-h k C-M-r
	C-h k C-M-s
	C-h k C-M-t
	C-h k C-M-u
	C-h k C-M-v

	C-M-r : isearch-backward-regexp, do incremental search backward for regular expression.
	C-M-s : isearch-forward-regexp, do incremental search forward for regular expression.
	C-M-t : transpose-sexps, interchange characters around point, moving forward one character, but applies to sexps.
	C-M-u : backward-up-list, move backward out of one level of parentheses.
	C-M-v : scroll-down-command, scroll text of selected window down ARG lines;
	 	 or near full screen if no ARG.

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : I found out descriptions of the keystroke C-g by using command “C-h k” followed by the keystroke C-g.

Answer : C-h k C-g

	 C-g : command keyboard-quit, signal a `quit' condition.
	 During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
	 At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes?
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Explanation : Based from the emacs reference card, I use "C-h f" to look up the descriptions
	      of the yank function

Answer : C-h f yank

         yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function.
         yank function reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
         It can be easily invoke by “C-y”

15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the
ls -l command,and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command?
List any shell or Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

Answer : ls -l /usr/bin
         emacs
         C-h f dired
         C-x d del del /usr/bin  (del refer to the delete keyboard)		

        Both command shows file type, user, group, other permissions, number of hard links
        user name, group name, size, date/time last modified, filename.
        However, the Emacs dired command also shows total number of directory and the
        number of available directory from there. The total number of directory from Emacs
        is larger than the total number of directory from the Linux panel. 
        Emacs : 297928
        Linux : 297852
